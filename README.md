Odds App is an up to date, Major League Baseball odds tracker that provides each user a simple, yet productive experience. While providing users with pre-game, live-game and post-game odds for the current MLB season, Odds App also provides current, and past-time news coverage and updates.

This application was a group effort, providing strengths of multiple people in a group setting. In this project, my primary focus was building the grid layout, contributing in working the API, and provding the UI to the application.

In the home page of this project, you will find up to date news articles, pre-game data, current-game data, and post-game data all generated through the sportsdataIO API. 

Inside of the pre-game boxes, you will find a clickable box that will generate pre-game, and live-game modals that will give you up to date odds of the game.
